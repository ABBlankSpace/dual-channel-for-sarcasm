Sometimes, they offer a separate alternative.   That argument cuts both ways.   The question comes up regarding what's YOUR beef on the issue?   Why are you so insistent on maintaining two separate groups?   Is it because you want to reserve marriage as ""prestigous"" whereby gays are kept out?   Under interracial marriage, no black person was prohibited from marrying either.   Should people have been satisfied with interracial couples being classified as ""civil unions""?   Today, we recognize that racism is wrong.   Yet some people still persist with homophobia. They fail to have a historical context on the real meaning of the methodology they recommend.   Frankly, that's like saying ""You can't be Jewish, but you can pick any sect of Christianity you want to. You can't wear a star of david, but you can wear a cross.   So that's *equal*""...   You're saying we can marry HETEROSEXUALLY, so HOMOSEXUALS must pretend that's equal???   Makes no sense...   If I call somebody ""male"", that restricts no rights from them.   It doesn't require they go to a separate place to get their rights.   And quite frankly, insisting on keeping one definition FOR A RIGHT (at the exclusion of gays) is ""satisfying the ego"" of the homophobic group.   ""attack on the definition of marriage""?

I have already listed on a number of posts why it's not constitutional.   Since you missed it (It's only the first post in the thread)   For gay coupes right to be married (Or the same legal status)   1. Human rights with regards to legal classifcation and the benefits therein are desired by comitted consenting adults of the same gender.   2. It's a contract between two consenting adults.   3. A contract that does not violate anyone's legal rights or cause any significant ill effects to the public welfare.   It's unconstitutional to allow one group of people access to marriage rights (hetero couples only), and not allow it to female/female and male/male couples when they are obviously lobbying for it in significant numbers. It's now a public issue on a significant scale.   Of course, maybe if you had a REASON for objecting to gays being treated equally with regards to the rights of marriage, we would understand not only why you are reluctant to back your claim, but why your reason is also not constitutional.   You can call it games, I call it justifying my position while pointing out how opponents of gay rights, such as yourself, really can't make any reasonable justification for their desire to restrict human rights, other than saying ""well I want to""...or in your case... ""shhh...it's a secret"".   You know what WE call it on the debate forum when one side refuses to present or rebut arguments? Losing the debate.
